__`Hi, my name is Ammon Haggerty (@ammonhaggerty)`__

`I love building things. Physical things, digital things, virual things, conceptual things. Things that do things. Things that make people happy. Things that make me happy.`

`I started programming when I was 12. I studied Lisp in school when I thought it would help me build robots. I learned Hypercard to make cool shit for my Mac Plus. I got a job coding Lingo for CD Roms. `

`Then I discovered DESIGN. Graphic design, typography, letterpress, screen printing, grid systems, color theory. So much fun. I made graphics for clothing companies, skateboars, musicians, clubs, magazines.`

`Then I discovered coding + design. I spent 20 years as a design technolist. Making cool websites for Nike, The Olympics, Redbull, MTV...`

`I got board with the web and joined a band of pirates call Obscura Digital and we made physical/digital immersive experiences. I designed and build displays and novel computing paradigms.`

`I had a kid, so I went to Microsoft and worked with Blaise Aguera y Arcas on fun stull like Holo Lens, Cortana, Photosynth, new computing paradigms. `

`Then I went to BCG. Don't know why I swallowed that fly. Playing with the big business boys.`

`Created a startup called Formation and raised some $$. Built the loyalty program in Haskell for Starbucks and United Airlines. Got tired of enterprise software. `

`Started another startup. This time it's a good one called Joinable. Check it out. `
