__`Hi, my name is Ammon Haggerty (@ammonhaggerty)`__

`I love building things. Physical things, digital things, virtual things,`[`conceptual things.`](https://qaswa.com/sixth-sense)`Things that do smart things. Things that make people happy. Things that make me happy.`

`I studied LISP in school since I thought it would help me build smart robots, but couldn't figure out how to apply it in real life (until much later).`

`Discovered DESIGN! Graphic design, typography, letterpress, screen printing, grid systems, color theory, art. I made designs for t-shirts, skateboards, album covers, club flyers,`[`magazines,`](https://qaswa.com/rhythmos-issue-2)[`brands.`](https://qaswa.com/37signals)

`Re-discovered code. CODE+DESIGN=!!! I spent the next 15 years as a design technologist. Making cool websites for`[`Nike,`](https://qaswa.com/nike-skateboarding-v3)`The Olympics, Redbull, MTV.`

`Joined a band of pirates call Obscura Digital and we made physical/digital`[`immersive experiences.`](https://qaswa.com/facebook-ar)`I designed and build hardware displays and`[`novel computing paradigms.`](https://qaswa.com/bluescape)`We designed the`[`Las Vegas Sphere`](https://www.thesphere.com/)`for the King of Dubai, but was too much $$ — finally built long after I left.` 

`Went to Microsoft to work with Blaise Aguera y Arcas on fun stull like HoloLens, Cortana, Photosynth,`[`futuristic wearables.`](https://qaswa.com/serendipity-watch) `Ended up deep diving into agentic AI scenarios (we were a little early).`

`Went to BCG. Don't know why. Playing with the big business boys.`

`Created an AI startup called`[`Formation`](https://qaswa.com/formation) `and raised some $$. Built the loyalty program for Starbucks and United Airlines in Haskell (no engineering, just cheerleading). Acquired by BCG.`

`Started another startup called`[`Joinable,`](https://joinable.us)`aiming to help address the lonliness and isolation epidempic by encouraging 'social fitness'. Ran out of money, but it's still limping along.`

`Currently exploring creative applications of GenAI — a couple I like quite a lot.`

[`SNDOUT`](https://sndout.com)`is a music discovery app that mines LLMs for music graph knowledge — showing the relationships between artists, and provides a view into the cultural context of artists, their locations, time, influences, etc.`

[`My Digital Twin`](https://qaswa.com/twin)`is an attempt to build a proxy agent that genuinely projects my creative background and interests as a rich-media experience. It's also research and commentary on issues of privacy, trust, and ethical AI. I've`[`made parts of the project open`](https://github.com/ammonhaggerty/my-digital-twin)`under a Responsible AI License (RAIL), sharing my training corpus for discussion and analysis.`

I created a [`Personal Agent Exchange protocol`](https://github.com/ammonhaggerty/PAEX)` to help AI-powered personal agents safely negotiate data exchange. The protocol builds on FIPA, a 27 year old standard for intelligent agent communication.  

`Now advising some companies(`[`Halcyon`](https://halcyon.eco)`and`[`Pave`](https://pave.team)`) and helping companies explore AI transformation.`
