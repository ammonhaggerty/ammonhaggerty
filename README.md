__`Hi, my name is Ammon Haggerty (@ammonhaggerty)`__

`I love building things. Physical things, digital things, virtual things,` [`conceptual things`](https://qaswa.com/sixth-sense)`. Things that do things. Things that make people happy. Things that make me happy.`

`I started programming when I was 12. I studied Lisp in school when I thought it would help me build robots. I learned Hypercard to make cool shit for my Macintosh Plus. I got a job coding Lingo for CDRoms. `

`Then I discovered DESIGN! Graphic design, typography, letterpress, screen printing, grid systems, color theory, art. I made designs for t-shirts, skateboards, album covers, club flyers,` [`magazines,`](https://qaswa.com/rhythmos-issue-2) [`brands.`](https://qaswa.com/37signals)

`I re-discovered code. CODE+DESIGN=!!! I spent the next 15 years as a design technologist. Making cool websites for `[`Nike,`](https://qaswa.com/nike-skateboarding-v3)` The Olympics, Redbull, MTV. Made the first web-based` [`reality show`](https://qaswa.com/first-ascent) `in 1998.`

`I got board with the web and joined a band of pirates call Obscura Digital and we made physical/digital` [`immersive experiences`](https://qaswa.com/facebook-ar)`. I designed and build hardware displays and` [`novel computing paradigms.`](https://qaswa.com/bluescape)

`I got married and had kids, so I went to Microsoft to work with Blaise Aguera y Arcas on fun stull like HoloLens, Cortana, Photosynth,` [`futuristic wearables.`](https://qaswa.com/serendipity-watch)

`Then I went to BCG. Don't know why. Playing with the big business boys.`

`Created a startup called` [`Formation`](https://qaswa.com/formation) `and raised some $$. Built the loyalty program for Starbucks and United Airlines in Haskell. Got tired of enterprise software. `

`Started another startup. This time it's a good one called` [`Joinable`](https://qaswa.com/purpose-and-belonging)`. Check it out!`
