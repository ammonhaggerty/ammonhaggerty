__`Hi, my name is Ammon Haggerty (@ammonhaggerty)`__

`I love building things. Physical things, digital things, virtual things,`[`conceptual things.`](https://qaswa.com/sixth-sense)`Things that do smart things. Things that make people happy. Things that make me happy.`

`Started programming Basic when I was 12. I studied Lisp in school since I thought it would help me build smart robots. I learned Hypertext to make cool shit for my Macintosh Plus. I got a job coding Lingo for CDRoms in 1990.`

`Discovered DESIGN! Graphic design, typography, letterpress, screen printing, grid systems, color theory, art. I made designs for t-shirts, skateboards, album covers, club flyers,`[`magazines,`](https://qaswa.com/rhythmos-issue-2)[`brands.`](https://qaswa.com/37signals)

`Re-discovered code. CODE+DESIGN=!!! I spent the next 15 years as a design technologist. Making cool websites for`[`Nike,`](https://qaswa.com/nike-skateboarding-v3)`The Olympics, Redbull, MTV. Made the first web-based`[`reality show`](https://qaswa.com/first-ascent)`in 1999.`

`Got board, so joined a band of pirates call Obscura Digital and we made physical/digital`[`immersive experiences.`](https://qaswa.com/facebook-ar)`I designed and build hardware displays and`[`novel computing paradigms.`](https://qaswa.com/bluescape)

`Went to Microsoft to work with Blaise Aguera y Arcas on fun stull like HoloLens, Cortana, Photosynth,`[`futuristic wearables.`](https://qaswa.com/serendipity-watch) `Ended up deep diving into agentic AI scenarios (we were a little early).`

`Went to BCG. Don't know why. Playing with the big business boys.`

`Created an AI startup called`[`Formation`](https://qaswa.com/formation) `and raised some $$. Built the loyalty program for Starbucks and United Airlines in Haskell (no engineering, just cheerleading). Got tired of solving enterprise software problems.`

`Started another startup called`[`Joinable.`](https://joinable.us)`, aiming to help address the lonliness and isolation epidempic by encouraging 'social fitness'. Ran out of money, but it's still limping along.`

`Now advising some companies(`[`Halcyon,`](https://halcyon.eco)`and`[`Pave,`](https://pave.team)`) and helping companies explore AI transformation.`
